# Banking_system
The code sets up a simple banking system with classes Account (for transactions) and Bank (for managing accounts). Users can deposit, withdraw, open, close accounts via a menu. Basic programming concepts are used.
The code represents a basic banking system with two key classes: Account and Bank. 
The Account class handles individual account details and transactions. Users can deposit and withdraw funds, and the class tracks account numbers. The Bank class manages multiple accounts, enabling users to open, close, and manage accounts. 
The main function offers a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the banking system. 
The code emphasizes foundational programming concepts like classes, file handling, and exceptions. 
It provides a simplified introduction to banking operations but lacks advanced security and error-handling features needed for a real-world system.
